   For 0.8.7

   o The mtz button on the refmac dialog

* Done.

   o New EDS Location [John Berrisford]

* Done.

   o PDBe files sfs cif location

* seems OK, problem with python interface.


   For Release 0.8.8

   o if the chain has a TER and we add NCS residues, then the
   old/current TER should be deleted.

   o enable mol2 reading to pyrogen

   o Ligand Builder -> Open [cif dictionary] Failures
     110 (butyl carboxylic acid - Oxygen formal charge)

   o Fix make check on test chemical features

* Done.

   o New EDS Location [John Berrisford]

   o Get some RNA - check that base pair restraints generation works
     (user-defined restraints).  Donna M.

   o display ligand distortions, move and regularize, display ligand distortions. 
     Clear generic display objects -> not all graphics objects are removed - they 
     should be.

   o Fetch molecule: acyclovir, (edit?) click Apply
 
   o make a small buccaneer test

   o write a test that runs findwaters 

   o write a test that runs findligand

   o is git-revision-count correctly generated by make-dist-with-rev-and-ww2-put.sh?

   o for master: why doesn't OXT bond to C in GLU in 313 A of 5elv? 
     [refinement branch]

   o remove debugging:

debug:: switch for sequence_view for imol 0 is 0x0

   o resolve the GSL problem. If no GSL fail in configure?  Or perhaps correctly 
     conditionally compile without it (not usage of $prefix/bin/gsl-config)

   o graphics-info-modelling.cc: for (int iflash=0; iflash<2; iflash++) { 
	allow flash of 1.

   o in interface to render: make bonds to hydrogens be thinner.

   Lukasz Wojtas:

   1) From res file When I try to show ANISO atoms WinCOOT stops working and shuts down. 

   2) exported coordinates and U's round off like in shelxl

      EXPORTED: C1    1  0.501129985  0.671778977   0.518324018
      SHELXL:   C1    1    0.501130    0.671779    0.518324    11.00000    0.24195

   3) When I try to fix coordinates temporarily by adding 10 - WinCOOT treats 
      it as actual coordinate and not fixed one so atom is shifted. 

   o when you mutate from an MSE the mainchain should revert to ATOMs

   o import imidaloze from lidia in coot. c.f. stand-alone

   o put the bond, angle, plane, nbc most distorted bonds in the refinement lights dialog

   o think about this leak:
