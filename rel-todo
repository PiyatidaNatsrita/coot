   For Release 0.8.9.1

   o make a function to left-hand align the text of the molecule names in the display manager
     use gtk_misc_set_alignment() when filling the display manager
     perhaps API function display_manager_entries_set_x_alignment(0.5)
     ::: 0.5

   o parse an alignment

   o map weights for cryo-EM carbohydrate fitting ::: 2

   o GM sigma and alpha for carbohydrate fitting ::: 2

   o the half-bonds of a C-S bond (e.g. CYS) doesn't add the correct atom indicies ::: 2

   o long bonds in bonds representation ::: 2

   o try to flev a residue that doesn't have a dictionary.  Give me a better
     means of seeing that things went wrong or what went wrong

     e.g. valence error (if you can manage the setup such a problem).

     ::: 2

   o reopen LSQ fit - the display says 24 but it chooses 0 for the reference molecule ::: 1

   o Make RCrane work again ::: 4

   o Crash on read thing.map.gz as a map.

     Can't reproduce.  Perhaps depends on the map.  I guess that the
     clipper::CNSMAPfile::open_read() is failing.

     ::: 1

   o refmac-multi-sharp.sh should be a window in coot ::: 1

   o read in a PHE, write out an ins - it fails due to no cell - but this is not
     apparent in the gui. ::: 1

   o Give me a function so that I can set the cell. ::: 1

   o Give me a function so that I can set the cell and symmetry from that of another molecule. ::: 1

   o update the symmetry (draw it) after a merge molecule  ::: 1

   o document how to remove contact dots. ::: 0.5

   o document how to remove additional representations ::: 0.5

   o Fun: make an auto-ncs-jump function: Use 3whe (for example) ::: 1


--------------

   o adjust the lights in draw_display_list_objects() ::: 0.5

* Done

   o when you reject intemediate atoms of a very bumpy solution, then it should delete, or undisplay
     the contact dots of generic display objects ::: 0.5

* Done.

   o Donna Matzov: can the mutate residue range gui be used for nucleic acids (instead of
     us having to use the scripting window)?

* Yes. Donna, Christmas came early this year ;-) I also changed the dialog to show when there
   was a sequence number match. ::: 1.5

   o Also add a counter or a marker that the residue range and the number of
     residues match ::: 2

* Done.

   o Replace residue -> ADE -> A -> crash ::: 2

* Done.

   o Make Link needs a redraw after link has been made ::: 0.5

* Seems OK (now?)

   o coot-reduce: Add N-terminus amide Hydrogen atoms ::: 2

* Done.

   o refine: make sure we can correctly refine N-terminus amide hydrogen atoms ::: 2

* Done.

   o mark_multiple_atoms_as_fixed_py needs a scm version ::: 0.5

* Done.

   o get a low resolution map and sphere refine. Look at the borders between moving and non-moving
     Are the non-bonded contact restraints working correctly? Perhaps the Hydrogen atom non-bonded
     contacts? ::: 1

* Done.


   o Jiggle Fit: Cut out the A chain from tutorial-modern.  Rotate/translate it for a test
     orientation.  Jiggle-fit this molecule or chain. It gets close. It seems to need a
     rigid body fit. Does this mean that the top 10 solution optimization is not working? ::: 0

* I don't think that this is a thing.

   o enter an invalid SMILES into lidia ::: 1

* Done.

   o make the scripting windows wider ::: 0.5

* Done.
