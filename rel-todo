   For Release 0.8.9.2


------


   o this was from coot-experimental but maybe it's a problem here.

* Done as much as I can from this, I think

   o somewhow draw the baton so that the direction is obvious. As an arrow, perhaps?

* Done

   o Delete extra restraints - does that work?

* Yes - I wonder what I thought the problem was.

   o Capture the mmdb error message ("Disk quota exceeded or some such") when
     trying to save/quick-save a pdb file).

* There's already a dialog on error on write - that will do for now (it doesn't say the error type)

   o when multi-sharpen fails because there is no refmac, we should get a message
     in the status bar.

* Done - something like that.

   o Add map resolution from grid spacing to Map Properties dialog - Bernhard Rupp.

* Done.

   o when generating density lines, check for is-EM map, and if so, don't draw outside
     the boundaries of the cell.
     This needs to know that a reboxed map is *not* an EM map because it can have density
     outside of the unit cell - to include reboxed map, it needs to have x,y,z limits
     derived from the grid box.
     Remove the current box restriction and move to refinement

* Done.

   o zero occupancy markers should respect the model molecule display limit

* Done.

   o zero occupancies markers for hydrogens should respect the no-bonds-to-hydrogens
     setting

* Punt. Too hard too esoteric.

   o accept_regularizement() needs a better name (keep this one for backwards compatibility)

* Done.

   o Label for "Limit Model Display Radius" should have a ...

* Done.

   o N-linked Additon -> remove the word "Dialog"

* Done.

   o Oliver-Clarke bonding

*Done! Yay.

   o Pointer distances should not show distances to Hydrogen atom if they are not displayed!
     Steven Sherrif

* Done.

   o do the bug fix for Robbie.

* Done.

   o CA-Zone -> mainchain on a zone that includes negative residue numbers -> crash
     Oliver Clarke. ::: 2 h

* Done.

   o remove default adding of monomer on read cif dictionary

* Done.

   o when I have undisplayed hydrogens, I don't want to ever pick them during refinement.
     Fix. ::: 1

   o G is reverse JED
 
* Done.

   o While we are at it, I don't want to pick atoms at the back when I am refining either.

   o copy fragment should have a "move it here" button. ::: 0.5

     ::: 1

   o make a patch for clipper hkl_data.h line 421 :: 0.5

   o graphics_info_t::read_standard_residues() uses

     std::string l = package_data_dir();

     ::: 0.5

   o Fe-S needs to be rendered nicely in Bonds mode ::: 2

   o Coot found no unexplained blobs" dialog should have a better title
     than "dialog1" ::: 0.5

* Done, needs testing.

   o crash on coot-reduce on luigi/3p4gA_dom1.pdb ::: 1

   o Kill off Lidia -> View in Lidia, prodrg path ::: 0.5

   o this is running coot-refinement and pressing Apply in Lidia

    ::: 1

* Bleugh. Bye bye.

   o Jiggle fit uses linear interp? Jiggle fit should select backbone
     if fitting protein, ring atoms for RNA/DNA ::: 2

* Done. More tricky than expected. Nice.

   o make restraints for a big protein, then delete them using ...
     delete deviants(?) Fix the slowness ::: 2

* Done. Nice.

   o morph fit by secondary following the cryo-tutorial, morph secondary
     fit makes a helix go wonky. Check with self chain restraints [JED]. ::: 0

* Can't reproduce.

   o reposition the O on the current residue when adding a new one -
     Add Terminal Residue execute_add_terminal_residue() ::: 1

* Done.

   o greg-tests: "Correction of CISPEP test"
     Don't run grep ::: 0.5

* Done. call-with-input-file read-line port

   o Add LINK info to header browser. Other things? ::: 2

* SSBOND bonds are not part of mmdb, BIOMT is a REMARK 350 and is already there.

   o seems to be a failure of peptide plane restraints when residue type is a PRO.
     (converted to a ALA and things flattened out as expected). But is this a problem
     only in refinement branch? ::: 1

* Add planar peptide restraints for PTRANS. Yay.

   o maybe add external angle restraints. Make them work in mini-rsr too ::: 2

* Done. Nice (tested).

   o Eleanor's HIS. Add test. This is tricky, it uses mgtree ::: 2

* Done with a bit of a hack in atom ordering.

   o Make RCrane work again ::: 2

* Done - residue_info() had changed.

   o Update the density fit graph on delete zone ::: 1

* Done.

   o fix crash in all_molecule_ramachandran_score_py() ::: 0.5

* Done.

   o put this in the status-bar:

* Don't see the problem

   o fix this in molecule-class-info.h:
      // Ugh.  Horrible.  I don't want outside access to setting of
      // imol_no - I want to do it in the constructor.  Must FIX.
      //
      void set_mol_number(int i) ...
      ::: 1

   o Why no ligands in "CA + Ligands" on the Slt pdb? ::: 0.1 h

* Because the ligands don't match the dictionary. Is fine.

   o Does replace residue get the residue numbering right?
     Change the ALA at the end of a chain ::: 2

* Done. A solid 2. Took all day. 4.46pm now.

   o test that add-lsq-atom-pair and apply-lsq-matches works ::: 0.2

* Yeah it does - "LSQ by atom" is the test.

   o links (of renumbered residues) disappear on renumber residues ::: 1

* Done - update_any_link_containing_residue()

   o      ERROR:: C: last_restraints no cleared up
     on every frame of a rotate/translate molecule ::: 1 h

* Already Done? Now gives release version, as it should.

   o Add OXT to residue -> on a DAL -> triple bond? ::: 1 h

* It was because I was adding an ATOM to a residue with HETATM. Now the
  OXT is a HETATM too, if needed.

   o curlew on hal? ::: 1 h

     ::: 1

   o does multi-sharpen work?

* yes.

   o the application of a pir alignemnent needs to add a save.

* done.

     Make a test.

* Done.

   o Use fragment/linked-residues behind the CA-Zone -> Mainchain button

* Done

   o Mutate DNA in Mutate Residue Range (DNA generate in Ideal DNA/RNA)

* Done.

   o Don't use " CG " quoting in the cif file output by Edit->Restraints->Write

* Done.

   o sync Bernie

   o does the tree comprehension work? (Marilyn Yoder problem)
   o is the carbohydrate module in a working state?

*it does now.

   o ASN has Hydrogen atoms. How does cho builder work?

*it does now

   o 1abr 140B "Delete all carbohydrate" fail

* Insertion codes!
