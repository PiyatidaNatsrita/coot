   For Release 0.8.9.1

   o map weights for cryo-EM carbohydrate fitting ::: 2

   o GM sigma and alpha for carbohydrate fitting ::: 2

   o enter an invalid SMILES into lidia ::: 1

   o the half-bonds of a C-S bond (e.g. CYS) doesn't add the correct atom indicies ::: 2

   o long bonds in bonds representation

   o when you reject intemediate atoms of a very bumpy solution, then it should delete, or undisplay
     the contact dots of generic display objects

   o reopen LSQ fit - the display says 24 but it chooses 0 for the reference molecule

   o coot-reduce: Add N-terminus amide Hydrogen atoms

   o refine: make sure we can correctly refine N-terminus amide hydrogen atoms

   o Replace residue -> ADE -> A -> crash

   o Make RCrane work again

   o Make Link needs a redraw after link has been made

   o Crash on read thing.map.gz as a map

   o Donna Matzov: can the mutate residue range gui be used for nucleic acids (instead of
     us having to use the scripting window)

   o Also add a counter or a marker that the residue range and the number of
     residues match

   o mark_multiple_atoms_as_fixed_py needs a scm version

   o read in a PHE, write out an ins = it fails - no cell - but this is not
     apparent in the gui.

   o update the symmetry (draw it) after a merge molecule

   o document how to remove contact dots.

   o document how to remove additional representations

   o try to flev a residue that doesn't have a dictionary.  Give me a better
     means of seeing that things went wrong or what went wrong

     e.g. valence error (if you can manage the setup such a problem).

--------------

   o adjust the lights in draw_display_list_objects() ::: 0.5

* Done
