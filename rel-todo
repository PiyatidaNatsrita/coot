   For Release 0.8.9

   o the hydrogen is not drawn correctly on AC6 in Colour by Atoms. Additional half-bond. ::: 2

   o fix the oxygen charge on the ligand thumbnail of 3GP ::: 1

   o does pyrogen -p work? (after cairo fiddling) ::: 1

   o the hydrogen is not drawn correctly on AC6 in Colour by Atoms ::: 1

   o make cfc work again ::: 1

   o FLEV fail on A2005 in 5pb8 failure to construct rdkit molecule (in alt conf D) ::: 1

   o what about this interaction in refinement: N(n) - HA2(n+1) GLY (an H on the CA)?
     simple-restraint.cc: make_non_bonded_contact_restraints().  Is the HA2-CA-C angle
     in reduced_angle_info_container_t? 1iei, residue 19 A.
     Also 1-4 NBC: A 22 C (SER) -- A 23 ND3 (PRO)

    (define (linear-refine-residues imol chain-id r1 r2)
        (refine-residues imol (map (lambda(r) (list chain-id r "")) (range r1 (+ r2 1)))))

   o repeat previous refinement: wrap refine-zone using (stored) atom indices
     residue_range_atom_index_1 and residue_range_atom_index_2

   o make a mode "don't recontour the map on recentre". Add a "recontour" 
     toolbar button ::: 2

   o qq-plot-map-and-model - is it in the documentation (and redefines)? ::: 1

   o ACE, PCA and MSE should not be considered as ligands in go-to-ligand ::: 1

   o make benzoic acid in lidia - does it generate correctly in acedrg and
     pyrogen? ::: 2

   o pyrogen -nM -w -r Y03 fails ::: 1

   o thumbnail chemical diagram for ZES in 1iei - Carboxyl O should be O- or OH. Check others.
     (Interestingly FLEV has a O-).

   o chemical diagram for Acedrg dictionary for this molecule:
     COC(=O)C(=COC)c1ccccc1COC(N1C)=CC(=N1)C(=C2O)C=C(Cl)C=C2"
     Disable the conversion to NH+ if any bond to the nitrogen is aromatic.

   o Sat 3 Jun 2017 08:57:29 CEST should accept_moving_atoms() (which
     can be called via scripting) dismiss the add_alt_conf dialog?  I
     think yes at the moment. [Georg Kempf] ::: 1

   o add_alt_conf interface should have something like this:

      if (use_graphics_interface_flag) {
         if (refinement_immediate_replacement_flag) {
	    // dismiss dialog, act as if OK was pressed
	 }
      }

      Is this the same thing as above?

      ::: 1

   o Copy-molecule loses the NCS ghost info/tranformations (i.e. O doesn't work) ::: 1

   o Fix the documentation generation (coot-dox.cfg needs to be generated from coot-dox.cfg.in)
     because the source header files are not in the build directory. Useful?

     http://chris-miceli.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/integrating-doxygen-with-autotools.html

     ::: 2

   o how about a button that does the "Nice ligand pic" settings for me?

     ::: 1

   o do a better job of scaling the density fit analysis (say low resolution data).

     ::: 1

   o For glyco tree validation (matching vs oligomannose-tree etc) allow modes 
     liberal (current) and correct which needs correct residue types
     and link records. Also, tree validation needs to check the anomericity.

     ::: 4

   o if user has (add-module-carbohydrate) in ~/.coot, then coot should not
     stop saying unbound variable... i.e. either much of gui-add-linked-cho.scm should
     be in add-linked-cho.scm or all of it which is unconditionally
     loaded at runtime (but (of course)) is conditionally evaluated).

     ::: 1

   o on mutating a THR (or anything) to a PRO, remember to delete H. ::: 1

* Done (I think).

   o I don't like fat hydrogen (bonds) in Colour by Chain mode. ::: 2

   o when first molecule is not a protein.  Copy NCS residue range. coot-utils.scm 1533 ::: 1

   o in 2qc1, build a NAG, NAG, BMA. Centre on the first NAG, sphere refine or H-refine.  
     NAG-ASN bond is not properly accounted for ::: 1

   o pyrogen -Mn -c PDBe-ADP.cif -> minimation problem

bond  3231.21 [spec: model 1 "B" 464 "" " C1 " ""] [spec: model 1 "B" 141 "" " ND2" ""]

   ::: 4

   o build NAG, NAG, BMA.  In coot-reduce, HO4 should not be added at the links.
     And check that coot-probe looks good.  ;:: 1

   o undo and redo should update the Ramachandran plot ::: 1

   o delete_all_extra_restraints() should updates the extra restraints display ::: 1

   o need a delete extra restraints menu item ::: 1

   o update the display of the restraints even if the molecule is not displayed ::: 1

   o make cryo-EM mode in refinement work ::: 4

   o --splash-screen arb-image.png - does that work? ::: 1

   o GM distance summary. How many too long, how many too short. And (if possible) by 
     what amounts. ::: 1

   o parse Sameer's xml ::: 12

   o add a glyco, with extra GM distance restraints - delete residue
     (undo).  Now get lots of warning about missing atoms on the
     terminal (as coot tries to find the atoms for the extra
     restraints).  Tricky to fix, I think. ::: 4

   o get rid of this: 
     INFO:: setup minimol from mol: no spacegroup
     ::: 1

* Done.

   o get rid of this:
.... step_count: 880 step_count_lim 5000
     ::: 1

* Done, was fixed in refinement

   o fetch Bernie branch. consider new rama ::: 6

   o lidia molfile.mol should Do The Right Thing :::: 2

   o doing a merge and doing a chain chain ids should move over the Link records also.
     Add a test ::: 1

   o read the comp_id cifs with CSD coords ::: 4

* Needs a test

   o read in a monomer cif, get monomer.  Bond orders good?  ::: 2

* Done?

   o Re: go to ligand: JED: Can I make a list of "non-interesting comp-ids?" ::: 1

   o Fetch molecule: acyclovir, (edit?) click Apply ::: 2

   o does saving the state of backrub rotamers work? Yes, but the button doesn't show the 
     state at startup. ::: 2

   o add a colour-blind-enabled constructor for the coot::colour_holder (probably should 
     be in the default constructor, then make it an optional arg). ::: 1

   o Add a test for CISPEP card addition for the introduction of a cis peptide.
     Currently coot deletes wrong cispeps (only) (not adds new ones).  Needs
     thought. ::: 3

   o It appears that merging coordinates (read from cif with
     multi-character label_asym_id and auth_asym_id) in to another set
     of coordinates will assign single-character chain IDs to the source
     coordinates. Might it be better to just add a prefix to those ids?
        - Wolfram Tempel
     ::: 1

   o bad 2D layout IXY in 3wzy ::: 4

   o quick save view on a key. ::: 1

   o coot-probe: does it work with symmetry? ::: 6

   o coot-reduce: does it work with symmetry? (this is more tricky and less useful) ::: 10

   o get penacillin G from chemspider 
     CC1([C@@H](N2[C@H](S1)[C@@H](C2=O)/N=C(\Cc3ccccc3)/O)C(=O)O)C
     Acedrg it.
     Read in dict to coot, make a molecule, look at the thumbnail - backwards wedge bond
     ::: 4
 
   o lidia: import 
   CC(C)C[C@@H](C[C@H](O)[C@H](Cc1ccccc1)NC(=O)COc2c(C)cccc2C)NC(=O)c3cccc(N)c3
     change amine from meta to para - SMILES updates but drawing doesn't.
    ... Huh? ::: 6 
 
   o Pyrogen chirality: Using CCD files as input, make a dictionary and 
     either validate the coordinates (dictionary vs actual) chiral volume 
     or minimize and validate coordinates ::: 6

   o Pyrogen: add command line arguement to keep the coordinates from the 
     input CCD/mmcif file ::: 1

   o when mutating to MSE atoms become HETATMs. ::: 1

   o Ligand Builder -> Open [cif dictionary] Failures
     110 (butyl carboxylic acid - Oxygen formal charge) ::: 2

   o Fix make check on test chemical features ::: 1

   o comp_id C23, look at the thumbnail, or residue->2D, see that the Oxygen atom
     seems chiral - is the bond the wrong way round? ::: 2

   o like sphere refine, but only select residues that are linearly related to
     the active residue (Hmm... how to do the GUI for this...?) ::: 2
     -- Chris Oubridge

     maybe autozone 2 will do?

   o 3ggi sfs don't convert with mmcif-to-mtz. ::: 4

   o make test should do something useful [Tim Fenn]. ::: 2

   o if the chain has a TER and we add NCS residues, then the
     old/current TER should be deleted.  Write a test first. ::: 1

   o enable mol2 reading to pyrogen
     ::: 1

   o Get some RNA - check that base pair restraints generation works
     (user-defined restraints).  Donna M. ::: 2

   o display ligand distortions, move and regularize, display ligand distortions. 
     Clear generic display objects -> not all graphics objects are removed - they 
     should be. ::: 1

   o make a cootaneer test ::: 2

   o write a test that runs findwaters ::: 1

   o write a test that runs findligand ::: 1

   o is git-revision-count correctly generated by make-dist-with-rev-and-ww2-put.sh?
     ::: 1

   o remove debugging:

   debug:: switch for sequence_view for imol 0 is 0x0
   ::: 1

   o resolve the GSL problem. If no GSL fail in configure?  Or perhaps correctly 
     conditionally compile without it (not usage of $prefix/bin/gsl-config)
     ::: 1

   o graphics-info-modelling.cc: for (int iflash=0; iflash<2; iflash++) { 
	allow flash of 1.

   o in interface to render: make bonds to hydrogens be thinner. ::: 1

   Lukasz Wojtas:

   1) From res file When I try to show ANISO atoms WinCOOT stops working and shuts down. 
   ::: 1

   2) exported coordinates and U's round off like in shelxl

      EXPORTED: C1    1  0.501129985  0.671778977   0.518324018
      SHELXL:   C1    1  0.501130     0.671779      0.518324    11.00000    0.24195

    ::: 1

   3) When I try to fix coordinates temporarily by adding 10 - WinCOOT treats 
      it as actual coordinate and not fixed one so atom is shifted. 

   o when you mutate from an MSE the mainchain should revert to ATOMs ::: 1

   o import imidaloze from lidia in coot. c.f. stand-alone ::: 1

   o put the bond, angle, plane, nbc most distorted bonds in the refinement lights dialog ::: 2

   o think about this leak:     ::: 1

     Disable the conversion to NH+ if any bond to the nitrogen is aromatic.  ::: 1

* Done. Actually, disabled when 3 non-H bonds to N.

   o Fix make check on test chemical features ::: 1

* Done.

    libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::runtime_error: WARNING:: 
    Requested flexible molecule for ligand "RRQ" ::: 1

* Done. 

   o pyrogen -n -M -C ATP AMP.smi.  The atom names are ultra-quoted. ::: 1

* Fixed.

   o Renumber residue should have  ::: 4

    [    ] or o N-terminus 
           to 
    [    ] or o C-terminus 

* Done

   o in Ana's map after sequence assignment (which was very fast): it went into a long 
     stall - not sure what it was doing. Without fitting, the model had hideous mainchain

* Done. "Fitting" means real space refinement - hideous mainchain came from non-backrub rotamer search
  (now backrub rotamer search is enabled).  ::: 1

   o speed up accept after rigid body fit. ::: 1

* Done.

   o  can you read this: all-comp-ids/T/PDBe-TFH.cif.  Its OBS though.

* Too obscure

   o colour by occupancy and colour by B-factor don't work [Hans Raaijmakers] ::: 1

* Done.

   o Residue info should not show TER atoms ::: 1

* It doesn't.

   o version-full should say if we are compiled with modern-language and enhanced-ligand tools ::: 1

* It does now.

   o "Delete All Carbohydrate" on 5fuu is very slow. Fix. Needs  ::: 1
      delete_residues(imol, res_specs).

* Done.

   o copy a fragment that has a link.  The link is not copied into fragment molecule. ::: 1

* Done.

   o API access to write a cif file (if input file is cif... or pdb) ::: 1

* Done.

   o (cryo-EM) map molecules should save their sigma step to the state file ::: 1

* They do.

   o map_peaks*.py should make negative peaks [Oliver Smart] ::: 1

* Done.
