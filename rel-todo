   For Release 0.8.9.2

   o fill and use go_to_ligand_non_interesting_comp_ids: add_non_interesting_ligand_type()

   o loops: when the gap between residue number is small but the gap is large, we
     need to be able to represent that differently.

   o update the copyright in the about dialog?

   o Map Dialog, Setting 8 rmsd should move the block in the graph below

   o Add residue type to the ramachandran outlier button
     (shoudl the rama plot and the rama outlier have the same criterion?)

   o fix the colours of (say) 5vic in Calpha Backbone mode

   o check for double ligands and/or nan atoms when using set_merge_molecules_ligand_spec().
     Add it to the test (do I have a test already?)

   o Acedrg Link interface needs to be able to change the bond order and delete a bond.

   o Try rotate/translate on a chain by picking C4',B in B 2 of 2H0N

   o Andreas K:

   > Coot now adds new ligands to the chain of the corresponding protein. Refmac5 (5.8.0238) then adds two TER
   > records to that chain, one after the protein and one after the ligand. When now adding a C-terminal residue
   > in Coot, it will not remove the original TER record after the protein

------

   o Randy: update NCS matrices for "O" key after symm shift reference chain here

* fill_ghost_info() needs to be called again to regenerate the matrices.
  Done.

   o this was from coot-experimental but maybe it's a problem here.

* Done as much as I can from this, I think

   o somewhow draw the baton so that the direction is obvious. As an arrow, perhaps?

* Done

   o Delete extra restraints - does that work?

* Yes - I wonder what I thought the problem was.

   o Capture the mmdb error message ("Disk quota exceeded or some such") when
     trying to save/quick-save a pdb file).

* There's already a dialog on error on write - that will do for now (it doesn't say the error type)

   o when multi-sharpen fails because there is no refmac, we should get a message
     in the status bar.

* Done - something like that.

   o Add map resolution from grid spacing to Map Properties dialog - Bernhard Rupp.

* Done.

   o when generating density lines, check for is-EM map, and if so, don't draw outside
     the boundaries of the cell.
     This needs to know that a reboxed map is *not* an EM map because it can have density
     outside of the unit cell - to include reboxed map, it needs to have x,y,z limits
     derived from the grid box.
     Remove the current box restriction and move to refinement

* Done.

   o zero occupancy markers should respect the model molecule display limit

* Done.

   o zero occupancies markers for hydrogens should respect the no-bonds-to-hydrogens
     setting

* Punt. Too hard too esoteric.

   o accept_regularizement() needs a better name (keep this one for backwards compatibility)

* Done.

   o Label for "Limit Model Display Radius" should have a ...

* Done.

   o N-linked Additon -> remove the word "Dialog"

* Done.

   o Oliver-Clarke bonding

*Done! Yay.

   o Pointer distances should not show distances to Hydrogen atom if they are not displayed!
     Steven Sherrif

* Done.

   o do the bug fix for Robbie.

* Done.

   o CA-Zone -> mainchain on a zone that includes negative residue numbers -> crash
     Oliver Clarke. ::: 2 h

   o G is reverse JED
 
* Done.

   o While we are at it, I don't want to pick atoms at the back when I am refining either.

* SSBOND bonds are not part of mmdb, BIOMT is a REMARK 350 and is already there.

   o seems to be a failure of peptide plane restraints when residue type is a PRO.
     (converted to a ALA and things flattened out as expected). But is this a problem
     only in refinement branch? ::: 1

* Add planar peptide restraints for PTRANS. Yay.

   o maybe add external angle restraints. Make them work in mini-rsr too ::: 2

* Done. Nice (tested).

   o Eleanor's HIS. Add test. This is tricky, it uses mgtree ::: 2

      //
      void set_mol_number(int i) ...
      ::: 1

   o Why no ligands in "CA + Ligands" on the Slt pdb? ::: 0.1 h

* Because the ligands don't match the dictionary. Is fine.

   o Does replace residue get the residue numbering right?
     Change the ALA at the end of a chain ::: 2

* Done. A solid 2. Took all day. 4.46pm now.

   o test that add-lsq-atom-pair and apply-lsq-matches works ::: 0.2

     on every frame of a rotate/translate molecule ::: 1 h

* Done

* Already Done? Now gives release version, as it should.

   o Add OXT to residue -> on a DAL -> triple bond? ::: 1 h

* It was because I was adding an ATOM to a residue with HETATM. Now the
  OXT is a HETATM too, if needed.

   o does multi-sharpen work?

* yes.

   o the application of a pir alignemnent needs to add a save.

* done.

   o mutate an ALA with hydrogens to a GLY. HA floats away (it should be deleted).
     Make a test.

* Done.

   o Use fragment/linked-residues behind the CA-Zone -> Mainchain button

* Done

   o Mutate DNA in Mutate Residue Range (DNA generate in Ideal DNA/RNA)

* Done.

   o use comma to split fields in search monomer library. Flight-time fun.

* Done.

   o FLEV on A401 NPD of 5uat (after Hydrogenate region)

* What was the problem? Looks OK to me - apart from Star Wars.

   o distance, symmetry atom click first -> wrong first atom

* Done.

   o Don't use " CG " quoting in the cif file output by Edit->Restraints->Write

* Done.

   o sync Bernie

* Nothing new.

   o does the tree comprehension work? (Marilyn Yoder problem)
   o is the carbohydrate module in a working state?

*it does now.

   o ASN has Hydrogen atoms. How does cho builder work?

*it does now

   o 1abr 140B "Delete all carbohydrate" fail

* Insertion codes!

   o multiple maps - undefined refinement map - jiggle fit this molecule needs an dialog alert.

* Done.

   o When merging a ligand - allow the ligand to be in user-specified chain.
     Maybe a menu item "Merge this ligand" which uses new function
     merge_ligand(imol, current_residue_spec, into_mol, new_residue_spec)

* Done. Even added a test.

   o Make a trivial ligand in the ligand builder, run acedrg. make an incorrect ligand
     (valence error) and run acedrg - the previous ligand gets imported.

     -> Apply button should grey out if there is no SMILES string (perhaps)

* Done.

   o add-terminal-residue should do not make intermediate atoms and not do a rigid body fit.
     Use --no-startup-scripts to help test this.

* The second of those was already so, immediate addition mode changed.

   o Carmen question: ?

       If you are on the keyboard and doing rotamer, can you accept it with Enter?
       No.
       Fix it then.

* Done.

       Adding solvent molecules - add it to the right molecule - make the spacing bigger to make the widget bigger.

* Done.

   o Draw hydrogens is not respected in colour-by-chain mode.

* I wonder what I meant. It was respected, but colour-by-secondary-structure was not. I had been looking at the
  refinement build, which has (had?) different arguments. Fixed.

   o Add a test that fle_view with_png output makes a sensible file.

* Done

   o Add distance restraint - does that work? - What about helical restraints?
     Test with a distorted model in a very low resolution map.

* It's working fine. There needs to be a lot of them to make a serious impact on the refinement.

   o what has happened to RCrane?

* It has moved to Calculate

   o I don't like the double call to make_bonds() (it's in CA mode at least). Get rid of it.

* I don't see it.

   o OXT in residue type LYS fle_view_with_rditk() failure.
     New monomer library!?

* Punt.

   o Randy: origin removed patterson: what's next to fix?

Punt.

   o compare the origins of a rebox and maps from the EMDB - look for nxstart etc differences
     use mrcfile for convenience.

* Punt.

   o CryoEM tutorial says "choose a sensible weight for the map" - how do we do that Paul?

* Is this really a problem - if so, punt.

   o add symmetry and try povray - crash?

* Punt.

   o raster3d should show symmetry?

* Punt.

   o can you add a download for EMDB bundles?

* Punt.

   o does normal/old/standard cis-trans update the bonds?

* Yes
