   For Release 0.8.9.2

------

   o CA-Zone -> mainchain on a zone that includes negative residue numbers -> crash
     Oliver Clarke. ::: 2 h

* Done.

   o remove default adding of monomer on read cif dictionary

* Done.

   o when I have undisplayed hydrogens, I don't want to ever pick them during refinement.
     Fix. ::: 1

   o G is reverse JED
 
* Done.

   o While we are at it, I don't want to pick atoms at the back when I am refining either.
     ::: 1
   o Fix db_mainchain fragment/chain indexing bug. Oliver Clarke ::: 1 h

   o copy fragment should have a "move it here" button. ::: 0.5

   o Draw -> Cell and Symmetry -> symmetry colour should follow the
     real symmetry colour. But now the symmetry colour is not dynamic.
     Swings and roundabouts.

     ::: 1

   o make a patch for clipper hkl_data.h line 421 :: 0.5

   o graphics_info_t::read_standard_residues() uses

     std::string l = package_data_dir();

     ::: 0.5

   o Make Fe-S cluster SF4 (and FES?) drawn with bonds ::: 1

   o Fe-S needs to be rendered nicely in Bonds mode ::: 2

   o Add anom to PDB-redo output ::: 0.5

   o dictionary_radii() for Hamish. Return something JSON.
     a dictionary? with a dictionary of atoms the the radius as the data :: 1

   o Coot found no unexplained blobs" dialog should have a better title
     than "dialog1" ::: 0.5

* Done, needs testing.

   o crash on coot-reduce on luigi/3p4gA_dom1.pdb ::: 1

   o Kill off Lidia -> View in Lidia, prodrg path ::: 0.5

   o this is running coot-refinement and pressing Apply in Lidia

    ::: 1

* Bleugh. Bye bye.

   o Jiggle fit uses linear interp? Jiggle fit should select backbone
     if fitting protein, ring atoms for RNA/DNA ::: 2

* Done. More tricky than expected. Nice.

   o make restraints for a big protein, then delete them using ...
     delete deviants(?) Fix the slowness ::: 2

* Done. Nice.

   o morph fit by secondary following the cryo-tutorial, morph secondary
     fit makes a helix go wonky. Check with self chain restraints [JED]. ::: 0

* Can't reproduce.

   o reposition the O on the current residue when adding a new one -
     Add Terminal Residue execute_add_terminal_residue() ::: 1

* Done.

   o greg-tests: "Correction of CISPEP test"
     Don't run grep ::: 0.5

* Done. call-with-input-file read-line port

   o Add LINK info to header browser. Other things? ::: 2

* SSBOND bonds are not part of mmdb, BIOMT is a REMARK 350 and is already there.

   o seems to be a failure of peptide plane restraints when residue type is a PRO.
     (converted to a ALA and things flattened out as expected). But is this a problem
     only in refinement branch? ::: 1

* Add planar peptide restraints for PTRANS. Yay.

   o maybe add external angle restraints. Make them work in mini-rsr too ::: 2

* Done. Nice (tested).

   o Eleanor's HIS. Add test. This is tricky, it uses mgtree ::: 2

* Done with a bit of a hack in atom ordering.

   o Make RCrane work again ::: 2

* Done - residue_info() had changed.

   o Update the density fit graph on delete zone ::: 1

* Done.

   o fix crash in all_molecule_ramachandran_score_py() ::: 0.5

* Done.

   o put this in the status-bar:

     Sorry atom with name " CA " alt-loc "empty", res-no: 20, ins-code "", chain: "A" not found in molecule 0

    ::: 0.5

* Done.

   o replace fragment using Edit gui menu item ::: 0.2

* Done.

   o sync bernie ::: 1

* Done.

   o add labels to raster3d output ::: 2 h

* Done.

   o after a merge molecules, do a graphics draw ::: 0

* Don't see the problem

   o fix this in molecule-class-info.h:
      // Ugh.  Horrible.  I don't want outside access to setting of
      // imol_no - I want to do it in the constructor.  Must FIX.
      //
      void set_mol_number(int i) ...
      ::: 1

   o Why no ligands in "CA + Ligands" on the Slt pdb? ::: 0.1 h

* Because the ligands don't match the dictionary. Is fine.

   o Does replace residue get the residue numbering right?
     Change the ALA at the end of a chain ::: 2

* Done. A solid 2. Took all day. 4.46pm now.

   o test that add-lsq-atom-pair and apply-lsq-matches works ::: 0.2

* Yeah it does - "LSQ by atom" is the test.

   o links (of renumbered residues) disappear on renumber residues ::: 1

* Done - update_any_link_containing_residue()

   o      ERROR:: C: last_restraints no cleared up
     on every frame of a rotate/translate molecule ::: 1 h

* Done

   o coot in phal gives old (0.8.8) coot. ::: 0.1 h

* Already Done? Now gives release version, as it should.

   o Add OXT to residue -> on a DAL -> triple bond? ::: 1 h

* It was because I was adding an ATOM to a residue with HETATM. Now the
  OXT is a HETATM too, if needed.

   o curlew on hal? ::: 1 h

* Seems OK.

   o email about dynamic bond width from Erec Stebbins. ::: 3 h

* Done. Nice. I will use it.

   o does RCrane have a menu item again? ::: 1 h

* Done.

   o peptide flags needs to obey the radius limit too - if it was set. ::: 1 h

* Done.

   o fix the glib bug:
     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23199699/glib-critical-source-id-xxx-was-not-found-when-attempting-to-remove-it
     ::: 1

* Done?

   o Add coot-extended.

* Done.

   o Merge bernie  ::: 1 h

* Done - I hope

   o coot --version and --version-full ::: 1

* Works.

   o Authors and Journal in header browser? ::: 3 h

* Done.


   o SMILES -> Simple 3D ::: 1 h

* missing move_molecule_to_screen_centre_internal()

   o does multi-sharpen work?

* yes.

   o the application of a pir alignemnent needs to add a save.

* done.

   o mutate an ALA with hydrogens to a GLY. HA floats away (it should be deleted).
     Make a test.

* Done.

   o Use fragment/linked-residues behind the CA-Zone -> Mainchain button

* Done

   o Mutate DNA in Mutate Residue Range (DNA generate in Ideal DNA/RNA)

* Done.

   o use comma to split fields in search monomer library. Flight-time fun.

* Done.

   o cherry-pick e5278d7fad21a8813cccb78ed51b5cc038947a63 from refinement

* Done.


   o FLEV on A401 NPD of 5uat (after Hydrogenate region)

* What was the problem? Looks OK to me - apart from Star Wars.

   o distance, symmetry atom click first -> wrong first atom

* Done.

   o Don't use " CG " quoting in the cif file output by Edit->Restraints->Write

* Done.

   o sync Bernie

* Nothing new.

   o does the tree comprehension work? (Marilyn Yoder problem)
   o is the carbohydrate module in a working state?

*it does now.

   o ASN has Hydrogen atoms. How does cho builder work?

*it does now

   o 1abr 140B "Delete all carbohydrate" fail

* Insertion codes!
