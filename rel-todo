   For Release 0.8.9.2

   o test that add-lsq-atom-pair and apply-lsq-matches works ::: 1

   o links (of renumbered residues) disappear on renumber residues ::: 1

   o coot in phal gives old (0.8.8) coot. ::: 1 h

   o coot-reduce on a bit of carbohydrate (NAG-NAG?) ::: 1

   o coot-reduce on a bit of protein with DAL, rather than ALA ::: 1

   o Add OXT to residue -> on a DAL -> triple bond? ::: 1

   o morph-fit-by-secondary-structure-elements does a bad job for the loop at 202 with
     do-a-better-job-at-moving-the-loop-on-SS-morph-fit.pdb, 6771 ::: 4

   o email about dynamic bond width (April?) ::: 2

   o      ERROR:: C: last_restraints no cleared up
     on every frame of a rotate/translate molecule ::: 1

------

   o copy fragment should have a "move it here" button. ::: 0.5

   o Draw -> Cell and Symmetry -> symmetry colour should follow the
     real symmetry colour. But now the symmetry colour is not dynamic.
     Swings and roundabouts.

     ::: 1

   o make a patch for clipper hkl_data.h line 421 :: 0.5

   o graphics_info_t::read_standard_residues() uses
     std::string standard_file_name = PKGDATADIR;
     it should use
     std::string l = package_data_dir();

     ::: 0.5

   o Make Fe-S cluster SF4 (and FES?) drawn with bonds ::: 1

   o Fe-S needs to be rendered nicely in Bonds mode ::: 2

   o Add anom to PDB-redo output ::: 0.5

   o dictionary_radii() for Hamish. Return something JSON.
     a dictionary? with a dictionary of atoms the the radius as the data :: 1

   o Coot found no unexplained blobs" dialog should have a better title
     than "dialog1" ::: 0.5

* Done, needs testing.

   o crash on coot-reduce on luigi/3p4gA_dom1.pdb ::: 1

   o Kill off Lidia -> View in Lidia, prodrg path ::: 0.5

   o this is running coot-refinement and pressing Apply in Lidia

    ::: 1

* Bleugh. Bye bye.

   o Jiggle fit uses linear interp? Jiggle fit should select backbone
     if fitting protein, ring atoms for RNA/DNA ::: 2

* Done. More tricky than expected. Nice.

   o make restraints for a big protein, then delete them using ...
     delete deviants(?) Fix the slowness ::: 2

* Done. Nice.

   o morph fit by secondary following the cryo-tutorial, morph secondary
     fit makes a helix go wonky. Check with self chain restraints [JED]. ::: 0

* Can't reproduce.

   o reposition the O on the current residue when adding a new one -
     Add Terminal Residue execute_add_terminal_residue() ::: 1

* Done.

   o greg-tests: "Correction of CISPEP test"
     Don't run grep ::: 0.5

* Done. call-with-input-file read-line port

   o Add LINK info to header browser. Other things? ::: 2

* SSBOND bonds are not part of mmdb, BIOMT is a REMARK 350 and is already there.

   o seems to be a failure of peptide plane restraints when residue type is a PRO.
     (converted to a ALA and things flattened out as expected). But is this a problem
     only in refinement branch? ::: 1

* Add planar peptide restraints for PTRANS. Yay.

   o maybe add external angle restraints. Make them work in mini-rsr too ::: 2

* Done. Nice (tested).

   o Eleanor's HIS. Add test. This is tricky, it uses mgtree ::: 2

* Done with a bit of a hack in atom ordering.

   o Make RCrane work again ::: 2

* Done - residue_info() had changed.

   o Update the density fit graph on delete zone ::: 1

* Done.

   o fix crash in all_molecule_ramachandran_score_py() ::: 0.5

* Done.

   o put this in the status-bar:

     Sorry atom with name " CA " alt-loc "empty", res-no: 20, ins-code "", chain: "A" not found in molecule 0

    ::: 0.5

* Done.

   o replace fragment using Edit gui menu item ::: 0.2

* Done.

   o sync bernie ::: 1

* Done.

   o add labels to raster3d output ::: 2 h

* Done.

   o after a merge molecules, do a graphics draw ::: 0

* Don't see the problem

   o fix this in molecule-class-info.h:
      // Ugh.  Horrible.  I don't want outside access to setting of
      // imol_no - I want to do it in the constructor.  Must FIX.
      //
      void set_mol_number(int i) ...
      ::: 1

   o Why no ligands in "CA + Ligands" on the Slt pdb? ::: 0.1 h

* Because the ligands don't match the dictionary. Is fine.

   o Does replace residue get the residue numbering right?
     Change the ALA at the end of a chain ::: 2

* Done. A solid 2. Took all day. 4.46pm now.
