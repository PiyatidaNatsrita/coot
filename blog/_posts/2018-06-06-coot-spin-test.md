1. Open a new coot, with no state script

2.  Edit -> Map Parameters

 * Set the map radius to 12 
 
 * Set the map sampling rate to 1.8

4. Extensions &rarr; Load Tutorial Model and Data

5. Calculate &rarr; FPS &rarr; Yes

6. Zoom in until the density touches the edge of the screen

7. Draw &rarr; Spin View on

8. Watch the status bar...

[Note that the frame rate can top out at 60 FPS - syncing with the monitor refresh]

For me I had to turn up the radius to 60.0 &#8491; to get a frame rate of less
than 60 FPS (it was 50 FPS) on my new PC desktop.

Doing the same on my 2-year old MacBook Pro gave 5 FPS.

Perhaps 60 &#8491; should be the new standard, but for now, let's quote both
the FPS at a radius of 12 and at 60  &#8491;.
