title:  "Models with Duplicate Residue Numbers are Now Allowed"

I have now enabled the reading of models with duplicate residue-numbers and insertion codes
for different residues by default.

So this:

{% highlight python %}
allow_duplicate_sequence_numbers()
{% endhighlight %}

is no longer needed.
