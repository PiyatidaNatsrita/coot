So now we have labels, thanks to a request from Vito Calderone.

![Raster3D has labels]({{"../../../images/CQ6-label-bright.png"}})

![Raster3D has labels]({{"../../../images/CQ6-white-bg-2.png"}})

You can change the font size using:

{% highlight python %}
set_raster3d_font_size("3") # or some such
{% endhighlight %}
